## Usage

### Using the Sorter Class

To utilize the functionality provided by the `Sorter` class in `sorter.js`, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Sorter Class**:

    ```javascript
    const Sorter = require('./sorter.js');
    ```

2. **Create an Instance of Sorter**:

    ```javascript
    // Replace 'size' and 'members' with your desired values
    const sorter = new Sorter(size, members);
    ```

3. **Set the Team Size** (Optional):

    ```javascript
    // Set a custom size for teams
    sorter.setTeamSize(customSize);
    ```

4. **Execute Sorting**:

    ```javascript
    sorter.executeSorting();
    ```

5. **Access Teams Information**:

    ```javascript
    // Get all teams
    const teams = sorter.getTeams();

    // Get a specific team by index
    const specificTeam = sorter.getTeam(index);

    // Display teams in the console
    sorter.showTeams();
    ```

6. **Adding Members**:

    ```javascript
    // Add a single member
    sorter.addMember(person);

    // Add multiple members
    sorter.addMembers(persons);
    ```

7. **Importing Members from JSON**:

    ```javascript
    // Replace 'filepath' and 'member' with appropriate values
    sorter.importMember(filepath, member);
    ```

8. **Exporting Members to JSON**:

    ```javascript
    // TODO: Implement the exportMember method in Sorter class
    sorter.exportMember();
    ```

### Using the readJSONData Function

The `readJSONData` function in `jsonIO.js` assists in parsing JSON data for member information. Here's how you can use it:

1. **Import the Function**:

    ```javascript
    const readJSONData = require('./jsonIO.js');
    ```

2. **Call the Function with JSON Data**:

    ```javascript
    // Pass your JSON data to parse
    const parsedData = readJSONData(yourJSONData);
    ```

3. **Utilize the Parsed Data**:

    The function returns parsed data with member information.

    ```javascript
    // Use the parsed data as needed
    console.log(parsedData); // Example: Display parsed data in the console
    ```

Please ensure to replace placeholder values like `'size'`, `'members'`, `'filepath'`, `'member'`, and `'yourJSONData'` with actual data and variables from your application.
